# Setup Manual: Universal Technical PO Prompt
You can use prompt below for your project configurations in any of Chat AI Tools. 
This project can help you to quickly develop task, bug, feature description based on documentation. 
Required documents for this prompt: 
How your final outputs should look like: 
- feature_description_requirements.md
- bug_description_requirements.md
- task_description_requirements.md
Project Documents (which can be generated with current skill)
- [Project Name]_product_overview.md
- [Project Name]_system_architecture.md
- [Project Name]_Pulse_database_schema.md

The workflow how to make it work: 
1) Install architecture-audit skill into your project (or globally)
2) Run claude code and paste the prompt "Prompt to generate documentation" 
3) Review prepared documentation, fix mistakes if necessary. 
4) Create a project in Claude Code/Google Gemini/GPT 
5) As instructions to this project add prompt "Project Instructions prompt.md"
6) Insert required files and documents to make it work (see example below)
7) Save changes and use project for feature/task/bug description preparation 


## How It Works

The prompt turns Claude into a Technical Product Owner that reads your project documentation and generates developer-ready Jira descriptions (Features, Bugs, Tasks) using your team's templates.

## Setup Steps (5 minutes per project)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project Files

Create or rename the following files using your project name:

| File | Naming Convention | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Product Overview | `{ProjectName}_product_overview.md` | Business context, goals, scope |
| System Architecture | `{ProjectName}_system_architecture.md` | Services, APIs, integrations, data flows |
| Database Schema | `{ProjectName}_database_schema.md` | Tables, fields, relationships, constraints |

**Examples for a project called "Pulse":**
- `Pulse_product_overview.md`
- `Pulse_system_architecture.md`
- `Pulse_database_schema.md`

### Step 2: Prepare Your Templates (one-time, reuse across projects)

These three files are **project-agnostic** — create them once and reuse everywhere:

| File | What It Defines |
|------|-----------------|
| `feature_description_requirements.md` | Structure for Feature / Epic descriptions |
| `bug_description_requirements.md` | Structure for Bug reports |
| `task_description_requirements.md` | Structure for Task descriptions |

> **Tip:** You already have these from the AKWA project. Copy them as-is to any new project.

### Step 3: Create a Claude Project

1. Go to **claude.ai → Projects → New Project**
2. Name it: `{ProjectName} — Technical PO`
3. In the **Project Instructions** field, paste the universal prompt
4. **Find & Replace** `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with your actual project name (e.g., `Pulse`)
5. Under **Project Knowledge**, upload all 6 files:
   - `{ProjectName}_product_overview.md`
   - `{ProjectName}_system_architecture.md`
   - `{ProjectName}_database_schema.md`
   - `feature_description_requirements.md`
   - `bug_description_requirements.md`
   - `task_description_requirements.md`
6. Start a conversation and describe your Feature, Bug, or Task

## Quick Checklist

```
□ Universal prompt pasted into Project Instructions
□ {{PROJECT_NAME}} replaced with actual project name
□ Product Overview uploaded
□ System Architecture uploaded
□ Database Schema uploaded
□ Feature template uploaded
□ Bug template uploaded
□ Task template uploaded
□ Test with a sample request to verify
```

## What Happens If Files Are Missing

| Missing File | Impact |
|---|---|
| Product overview | Claude can still work but won't have business context; descriptions may lack "why" |
| System architecture | Claude cannot reference services, APIs, or data flows — will use `[TBD]` markers |
| Database schema | Claude cannot validate field/table names — will flag assumptions |
| Any template file | Claude will ask which format to use or fall back to a generic structure |

> The prompt instructs Claude to tell you what's missing before proceeding, so you'll always know.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Architecture & Schema docs are the highest-value files.** The more detailed they are, the more precise the output.
- **Be specific in your requests.** "Add filtering to the dashboard" is weak. "Add date-range and status filtering to the Appointments dashboard, filtering against `appointments.appointment_date` and `appointments.status`" is strong.
- **Use iterative refinement.** After the first draft, say "add edge cases for X" or "split acceptance criteria into positive/negative" — Claude will update in place.
- **Templates are yours to customize.** If your team uses a different Bug format, update `bug_description_requirements.md` — the prompt adapts automatically.
